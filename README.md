If you have access to your GitHub account that is linked on your Devpost page, please add a temporary README file that refers to this thread and grant access to testing@devpost.com. If you provide that link here, we can go ahead and delete your Devpost account for you.

Hi Zeal,
What is the URL to the account? We are not able to delete accounts without proof of ownership, so if the Devpost account itself is connected to a GitHub, LinkedIn or other account you still have access to, we may be able to help you.
Best,
Devpost Support

Hello,

My name is Zeal. I'd like to delete my devpost account, but I do not remember the password and I no longer have access to the account I used to create that account.

Thanks,
Zeal
